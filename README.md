# Data-Science-Project
This is my first Data Science Project. It is very basic and simple project. 
DataSet is available on https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.GROW?end=2018&start=1960&view=chart.
This project shows the population growth (annual %) of World with respect to the given counrtry.
This project is interactable, user has to enter country name, starting year and ending year for which user want to see the results in the form of plot.
